- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?
It is important to understand how class components work in order to maintain/ refactor legacy code.

- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.
1. Mounting - The creation of your component.
2. Updating - Building upon your component
3. Unmounting - The end of your components life cycle.

- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?
Custom hooks are a great way to keep your code DRY by making it easy to share/reuse state functionality between components

- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?
It is important to test apps to ensure that they perform as intended and are able to be easily interpreted by developers that may be introduced or take over our projects. They serve as clear documentation on how the app should function and how to ensure it remains functioning as new functionality/components are introduced.
